# Blink-and-Snap
This project was created to meet the requirements of our interdisciplinary project by Physics (Sahir Nagpal and Oliver Ashton) and Data Science students (Kathy Huang and Johnson Yun). In this project, we attempt to make an eye controlled camera to allow additional degrees of freedom to camera users as well as the physically disabled.

The key skills used in the project are signal processing, signal classifying, live streaming and camera integration.

All the details of the project are in the Final Report as a pdf file and the code as a Jupyter notebook.
